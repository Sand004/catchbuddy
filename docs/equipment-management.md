### Components Created

```
apps/web/
├── components/equipment/
│   ├── equipment-form.tsx    # Form for add/edit
│   └── equipment-list.tsx    # Grid display
├── lib/stores/
│   └── equipment-store.ts    # Zustand state management

packages/shared/
└── src/validations/
    └── equipment.ts          # Zod validation schemas

packages/ui/
└── src/components/
    ├── dialog.tsx           # Modal component
    └── input.tsx            # Form input component
```

### Testing Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd apps/web
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Run the App**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

3. **Test Equipment Management**
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3000
   - Log in with your account
   - You'll be redirected to `/equipment`
   - Click "Köder hinzufügen" to add equipment
   - Fill the form with:
     - Name: "Rapala Original Floater"
     - Type: "Köder"
     - Brand: "Rapala"
     - Model: "F11"
     - Color: "Silber"
     - Size: "11cm"
     - Weight: "6"
     - Tags: Add "wobbler", "hecht"
   - Save and see it appear in your list
   - Click on an item to edit
   - Hover over items to see delete button
   - Use search and filters to find items

### Data Persistence

All equipment data is stored in Supabase with:
- Row Level Security (only see your own equipment)
- Real-time sync capability
- Automatic timestamps
- User association

### Next Steps (Phase 2 Continuation)

- [ ] AI-008: Image Upload & Google Vision Integration
- [ ] AI-009: Receipt Parser for automatic import
- [ ] AI-010: Advanced gallery views
- [ ] AI-011: Offline-Sync Logic
- [ ] AI-012: Equipment Embedding Generation

### Known Limitations

1. **No Image Upload Yet** - Coming in AI-008
2. **Basic Search** - Full-text search coming with embeddings
3. **No Offline Mode** - Coming in AI-011

### Troubleshooting

**"Cannot read properties of undefined"**
- Make sure you're logged in
- Check Supabase connection

**Form validation errors**
- Name is required
- Weight must be a positive number
- Check browser console for details

**Items not saving**
- Check Supabase RLS policies
- Verify user authentication
- Check browser network tab
